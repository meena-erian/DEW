# DEW
A fancy way of naming my application "Drive Explorer for Windows"
##Overview
A common proble that annoys many windows users is that developing a malware to spreads like an epidemic from PC to pin drive and vice versa is too easy. One thing I like the most about windows is that as a developer, it supplies me by extra more power.
I hope my extremely simpl application protect many unexpert users from most newadays computer worms.
